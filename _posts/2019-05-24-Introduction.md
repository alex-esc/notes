# How to start a blog.

## Write a bunch. 

For me writing is therapeutic and cathartic. There's nothing more satisfying than having and idea and presenting it in a clever and easy to understand way.

If you have read my blog you know I have an urge to explain both technical concepts and ramble on and on about internet culture.

You'll need to find your voice though the topics that speak to you. About that I can't help as much as I'd like too. So now unto the good stuff.

## How to get your blog site up on the internet.

From now on expect technical stuff.

If a simple blog is all you need you came to the right place, as you can see this blog is some text with headers and links.

In this tutorial series I will teach you how to get a blog like mine up and running.

Don't worry, *if you don't like the look of my blog you can change it up later*. What matters is getting your work published first and worry about aesthetics second.

This tutorial will cover only how to set up this style of a blog, we won't go into detail about how to change the look of it.However you will find links pointing you in the right direction at the end.

## How to navigate this tutorial.

In the spirit of bloging this tutorial will be divided into several blog posts, so to find the next lesson head over to the blog archive.

In the blog archive you will find a list in reverse chronological order of all the post in the blog, use it to navigate between lessons.

Well this has been lesson zero, I'll see you on lesson 1.

At the top of the screen you will see the name of the blog **in big bold letters** and besides it you will see click-able links that say *Subscribe Archive About Me*. Click on the archive to see the list of posts.

Now let us continue!
