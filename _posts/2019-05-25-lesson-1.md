One thing to keep in mind going forward is that I'm broke. This blog will cost you nothing, *zero, nada*.

I will guide you trough my way of bloging for free - There are limitations of course - But nothing serious.

The most obvious part where I'm cheeping out is the blog's website. You may expect something like `blogyblog.com` on the URL bar at the top. Oh and by the way, thats called a domain name, you know, the name for your link or URL - The thing you type into the internet browser to open a specific website.

But the free method I use to get my links makes them end up like `blogyblog.github.io`.

Now if you want you can pay for a domain name, if you search the internet for *buy domain name* you will find several websites that sell normal URL's (like `example.com` sort of normal).

If you buy a regular domain name from one of those sorts of companies you can still follow this tutorial and use your premium non-free domain.

I recommend buying domains from [namecheep][1] or [google][2].

[1]: https://www.namecheap.com/
[2]: https://domains.google/#/

Remember that if you ever decide to get a paid dmain name in the future you can go the free route now and buy the domain later, I will teach you how to apply it after the fact. Now if you don't want to spend any money right now you may continue.

# WTF is github.io?

My dirt cheap way of bloging uses a thing called GitHub.

GitHub is a social media for programmers (kind of).

But instead of uploading photos and videos to share with your friends, on GitHub you upload programing code to share with other programmers.

**Woah! Stop right there, programming! do you think I'm some kind of hacker? If I don't know how to program how am I supposed to do this??!!**

Calm down, remember that GitHub is about programmers sharing their code, you will not need to program anything because I already did the code for you. I'm sharing my code with the world for everyone to use for themselves. You'll only need to change the blog's title to your own.

Now another cool thing about GitHub is that each program you share can be transformed into a free website!

And this websites are called GitHub Pages, all GitHub pages have a domain that end's in `.github.io`.

It works like profiles in other social media, for example Twitter:

If you choose the user name `@super-cool-dude-mango` then your twitter profile link will be `twitter.com/super-cool-dude-mango`. And the same goes for GitHub: if you choose the user name `@super-cool-dude-mango` you will get a GitHUb Pages website at `super-cool-dude-mango.github.io`.

And that's why my site ends with `.github.io`.

# How to get you GitHub page

## Sign up to choose your site's name

Because each GitHub user gets their own free page we need to sign up to GitHub first.

Go to [github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and create your account.

**Important**: remember that your username will dictate the link of your blog, once you choose your username you can't change it, choose wisely.

## Create your blog based of mine.

Remember how I already made the code for you so you don't have to program?

Well now you gotta make a new site based of my blog.

This is the time to explain *forking*. In GitHub *to fork* means to make a copy of somebody's work to add your own twist on it.

It's called forking because it's like taking a bite (stealing) food from your friend with a fork. *Hey man, want a taste of this? yeah go ahead - Fork!*

Forks are how small projects grow and evolve. Let's say I make a simple website with text, it's quite boring, so somebody forks it ad adds pictures, somebody else forks it and adds videos.... And so on until total robot domination.

Point being that forks allow programmers to improve each others stuff. In this case you will improve my blog by writing with your new and fresh perspective.

So now, how do you fork my blog?

## Step one, fork my site.

Head over to my blog's code. Each project on GitHub has it's own little place. My blog's code is over at: [github.com/alex-esc/post-clone]( https://github.com/alex-esc/post-clone.

You will see something like this:

Now click on the fork button.

![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)

Now you should see a little loading animation (with a fork stealing food from someone else's plate) and after a second or two you will see a new page that looks like the last place we were. Main difference is that it says at the top: *Forked from alex-esc/post-clone* at the top.

Now the title will look like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/Muleb1x.png)

> Note that in this example image it says `posts` instead of `posts-clone` and it says it's forked from `henrythemes/jekyll-minimal-theme`. This is a photo of my own blog, my blog is also a fork off somebody's else's blog pre-set.

Now you have successfully forked the programing code of blog. But to turn on the website you have to enable GitHub pages.


GitHub pages normally asks you to code your own website and then turn it on, but because you will base your blog off of mine you can skip the coding part and go strait to turning on GitHub pages.

But GitHub gives you a link with your username as long as a programing project (or code repository) if the project has the same name as your username, so let's change your fork so it's named like your username.

## Step two, rename your site to fit your username.


![](https://i.imgur.com/v54A0ym.png)

Click on settings and find the box that says repository name so we can change it.

![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/repository-name-change.png)

> in this example picture it shows _html-proofer_, yours will say _post-clone_.

Change `post-clone` for your user name, it must be written exactly as your user name.

After you wrote your user name add `.github.io` and click on rename, you can rename as many times as you need.

> Example: if your user name is`coolblogs`, you must rename your site to `coolblogs.github.io`.


## Step tree, turn on your blog.


On the same settings menu you are in scroll until you see this:


![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/pages/none-source-setting.png)

Now click on the button that says _none_, then choose the option that says _master branch_ and then hit _save_.

What we just did was selecting what branch will be transformed into your site, by default the site is off, so there's nothing selected as the page's source. Now that we have chosen the master branch we are telling GitHub to use the whole project you forked from me as the code of the site.

Now the site is ready! You should see a green text box with a link to your site!

If you click on it, you will see that your site is a carbon copy of mine. But that's about to change, in the next lesson we will find out how to change the information I put in my blog for your information.

Stuff like a link to your social media accounts (in the about me section) and changing the header.

See you on lesson two!
